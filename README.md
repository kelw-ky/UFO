## Overview
Creating a webpage with an dynamic table which allows the user to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The top of the webpage looked like the following: 

![Webpage](/static/images/Webpage.png)

The current table and filter selection is shown below: 

![table](/static/images/table.png)

On the left side, where the Filter Search is location, the user is able to type what one wants to search. After the user has typed the requirements, pressing "Enter" or "Tab" to go to the next white box. The table will then automattcally update as shown: 

![Date](/static/images/Date.png)

The user can use all or selected the filters, and if there are no entries then the table will be blank.

## Summary

The data set for this webpage is very limited as there are only data from January 1st, 2010 to January 13, 2010.

To be more clear, when there are no entries, the table should show "No Entries". This would allow the user to actually know that there are no entries and that the table is not loading. Also, the filter search should allow a dropdown of the available options, since the filters are case senstive and there are multiple countries and not all users would be familiar with that.
